# [Errordactyl](https://errordactyl.com/)

Errordactyl is a tool that automates HTTP endpoint testing and error handling for web servers in the Node.js and Deno runtime environment.

* **Simple:** Errordactyl utilizes a configuration file to store all route endpoints and their associated HTTP methods, making it easy to access or modify custom routes.
* **Easy-to-run:** Errordactyl encapsulates its functionality into minimalist command line interface commands, allowing for a painless setup and execution. 
* **Readable:** Compiled error data gets returned from the error stream as a JSON object with elegant formatting to ensure error readability.
